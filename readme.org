* Elixir Talk (2020)

Slides of the talk I gave about Elixir on 29th of May 2020 at Spindle.

The [[https://c0deaddict.github.io/talk-about-nix-2018/][slides]] are generated from [[./index.org][this]] Org file with [[https://github.com/yjwen/org-reveal/][org-reveal]].
If you want to do this yourself you need Emacs and install the
org-reveal package. Then open the =index.org= file and press =C-c C-e R
R= this will generate the =index.html= file.

In the presentation press =s= to open the speaker notes.

** Demo

Here are the [[https://github.com/c0deaddict/demo_system][sources for the demo]]. Demo is originally by Saša Jurić,
used in his excellent talk [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE][The Soul of Erlang and Elixir]]
