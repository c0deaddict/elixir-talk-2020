#+begin_notes
Elixir is like Kotlin or Scala: a programming language running on a VM
that has another primary programming language. What Java is for
Kotlin, Erlang is for Elixir. And the same applies to the JVM and
BEAM: the VM on which Erlang bytecode runs.

Elixir can call Erlang code just like you can call Java functions from
Kotlin (and vice versa). Throughout this presentation I'm using the
words Elixir and Erlang mostly interchangeably.

#+begin_notes
Elixir, Erlang and BEAM are an ideal language and platform to create
applications or systems with these properties. I will explain why that
is in this presentation and in the demo that will come at the end.

#+begin_notes
Elixir also has these properties, in this presentation I'm not going
to focus much on this. 
#+end_notes

* Why?

#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
- Advent of Code 2019
- Vialer Middleware rewrite (VMex)

#+begin_notes
Each year I participate in the AoC. Each year I pester everyone to
also join. It is just an awesome challenge. Each year I pick a
programming language that I haven't used, and try to solve the puzzles
with it, and while doing that learn a part of the language.

Elixir and Erlang have been on my radar for a while. In 2009 I read
the book "Programming Erlang - Software for a concurrent world". I was
fascinated by it. But I did not understand how to make applications in
Erlang. It was too different from what I was used to: Java and PHP.

Ten years later, and a lot of languages in between, it now makes sense
to me. Learning Haskell and Clojure have laid a good foundation for
functional programming with recursion and immutable data structures.

The AoC is nice for learning the basic syntax and standard
library. But to really learn Elixir I needed an real application or
system to build. For this I picked the Vialer middleware. Since
January I have made rewrite of the Vialer middleware in Elixir as my
10% project.

My goal with this presentation is:
- Spark interest in Elixir and Erlang
- Convince everyone that the Erlang ecosystem is useful for Spindle
#+end_notes

* A bit of history

[[./images/history.jpg]]

#+begin_notes
In 1986 Ericsson is trying to solve the problem of reliable phone
switching. The most important success criterion is that such
applications *have to have zero downtime*. In the words of late Joe
Armstrong, one of the founding fathers of Erlang: *it was a quest to
write programs that run forever*. The outcome of this effort was
Erlang.

Erlang was open sourced in 1998 it slowly found it's way into
high-volume internet applications that involve messaging and
distributed computing. Several big projects chose Erlang as a language
to build upon: RabbitMQ, CouchDB, ejabberd, WhatsApp. The mindset that
went into creating Erlang (zero downtime, concurrent, scalable)
aligned well with web-scale applications.

Erlang is a big of strange language. It scored high on the "most
dreaded" languages in the Stack Overflow developer survey
of 2019. Erlang has a weird syntax inspired by Prolog: symbols
starting with a lowercase letter are constants (atoms). Variables
start with an uppercase letter. It has no support for meta programming
resulting in repeated code. Documentation is hard to read.

Elixir is created by Jos√© Valim in 2011. His goal was to create a
language that enabled higher extensibility and productivity in the
Erlang ecosystem, while keeping compatibility with it. Elixir is on
place number 8 in the most loved languages (stack overflow survey).

What makes Elixir great?
  - Focus on programmer happiness
  - Much easier Ruby-like syntax
  - Great documentation
  - Great tooling (mix: deps, build, test, release)
  - Metaprogramming: macro's and compile time polymorphism
#+end_notes

* What's different?

[[./images/let-it-crash.png]]

#+begin_notes
What makes Elixir different from other programming languages?

We've all seen it:
- Java programs crashing with NullPointerException's
- C and Go with segmentation faults
- Python with KeyError
- etc.

What makes Elixir different is that it embraces failure. The motto of
Erlang is "Let it Crash". This sounds dangerous, but thanks to the
BEAM runtime (the virtual machine), failure can be scoped and dealt
with inside the application at a granularity defined by the developer.
#+end_notes

** Why does restarting work?

#+attr_html: :width 50%
[[./images/off-and-on.jpg]]

#+begin_quote
131 out of 132 bugs are transient bugs -- Jim Gray in Why Do Computers
Stop and What Can Be Done About It? (1985)
#+end_quote

#+begin_notes
Elixir deals with failure in a very simple way, by turning it off and
on again. This may sound too simple, but it has proven very
effective. Just like failures can be contained to a desired part of
the system, so can the restarts that follow.

Why does restarting work at all?

According to a paper on software failures by Jim Gray (1985, old but
still relevant), software bugs can be divided in two kinds:

Bohrbugs: are simple, repeatable and easily triggered. Like the Bohr
atom, are solid, easily detected by standard techniques, and hence
boring. They are likely to be caught in testing and thus don't often
reach production.

The other kind are Heisenbugs: bugs that seem to disappear when you
look at them. Just like the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. These
bugs are usually dependent on many different factors and thus
difficult to reproduce. For these bugs retrying (restarting) is often
the best solution.

According to the paper, the Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of
systems handling bugs in this way better by a factor of 4.

Turning it off and on again is the right approach. Of course this is
not a carte blanche to ignore all these Heisenbugs, they still need to
be investigated.
#+end_notes

* Short tour

#+begin_notes
For the sake of brevity I'm going to skip a general introduction of
the Elixir syntax. The focus will be on the abstractions that make the
language unique.
#+end_notes

** Processes

#+reveal_html: <div class="vertical-split"><div>

#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
#+caption: Spawn
#+begin_src elixir
iex> pid = spawn(fn -> 1 + 2 end)
#PID<0.44.0>

iex> Process.alive?(pid)
false
#+end_src

#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
#+caption: Kill
#+begin_src elixir
iex> pid = spawn(fn ->
  Process.sleep(:infinity)
end)
#PID<0.44.0>

iex> Process.alive?(pid)
true

iex> Process.exit(pid, :kill)
true
#+end_src

#+reveal_html: </div><div>

#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
#+caption: Isolation
#+begin_src elixir
iex> x = 1

iex> Task.async(fn -> x = 3 end) |> Task.await
3

iex> x
1
#+end_src

#+reveal_html: </div></div>

#+begin_notes
Processes are the core abstraction in Elixir.

These are *NOT* OS processes. They are more like Green Threads,
Fibers, Go routines. BEAM uses one OS process per scheduler and one
scheduler per CPU core.

Creating processes is fast and cheap (limit is about 130M). This will
be shown in the demo.

Processes are fully isolated: they share nothing, not even memory, not
even a garbage collector. This isolation is good because it guarantees
that a dying process keeps issues to itself, it can't corrupt memory
of other processes.

BEAM uses preemptive scheduling, this means that it does not depend on
the program to "behave" (voluntarily giving up execution, most
programming languages implemenent cooperative scheduling). This
promotes fairness between scheduling of processes and gives the
runtime a soft-realtime behaviour. More on this later.

Explain code above.
- iex = Elixir REPL
- PID = Process ID
- Calling process immediately continues
#+end_notes

** Message passing

#+reveal_html: <div class="vertical-split"><div>

#+caption: Process A
#+begin_src elixir
send(
  process_b,
  {:hello, self()}
)

receive do
  reply ->
    IO.puts(reply)
end
#+end_src

#+reveal_html: </div><div>

#+caption: Process B
#+begin_src elixir
receive do
  {:hello, from} ->
    send(from, "Hello there")

  other ->
    handle(other)
end
#+end_src

#+reveal_html: </div></div>

#+begin_notes
Processes communicate via messages. Each process has it's own
mailbox. Everyone can write to it, but only the owner can read from
it. Messages are normally handled in the order they are received. But
with pattern matching, specific messages can be picked from the mailbox.

Messages are pure data, they cannot contain references to memory. In
the example a two-tuple with an atom (constant) and a process ID (of
process a) is sent as message.
#+end_notes

** Links

#+reveal_html: <div class="vertical-split"><div>

#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
#+caption: Loose
#+begin_src elixir
iex> pid = spawn(fn ->
  Process.sleep(5_000)
  raise "error"
end)
#PID<0.118.0>

iex> send(pid, :request)
:request

iex> receive do
  response -> response
end
... blocks forever since process will die ...
#+end_src

#+reveal_html: </div><div>

#+attr_reveal: :frag (appear)
#+caption: Linked
#+begin_src elixir
iex> pid = spawn_link(fn ->
  Process.sleep(5_000)
  raise "error"
end)
#PID<0.118.0>

iex> send(pid, :request)
:request

iex> receive do
  response -> response
end
... after 5 seconds when pid dies, so does iex ...
... crash report ...
... iex restarts ...
#+end_src

#+reveal_html: </div></div>

#+begin_notes
Every time two processes start having a converstation, an implicit
dependency is created between them. If process A sends a message to
process B and B dies without responding, A can either wait forever, or
give up on having a conversation after a while. Waiting for a limited
time (timing out) is a valid strategy, but it is vague one: it is
unclear if the remote end has died or if it's just taking
long. Off-band messages can arrive in your mailbox.

Erlang gives us two tools to deal with this problem in a different
way: Links and Monitors. First let's have a look at links.

Links: bind processes together. Whenever a process dies, all the
linked processes receive an exit signal. That exit signal will in turn
kill the other processes. This enables grouping a set of processes
together as one unit. This is useful because I can prevent my system
from accidentally crashing into unstable partial states.

Links are a tool that lets developers ensure that if a thing fails,
it fails entirely and leaves behind a clean slate, without impacting
components that are not involved.
#+end_notes

** Monitors

#+begin_src elixir
iex> pid = spawn(fn ->
  Process.sleep(5_000)
  raise "error"
end)
#PID<0.124.0>

iex> Process.monitor(pid)
#Reference<0.1858197913.2995257347.242321>
#+end_src

... after 5 seconds ...

#+begin_src elixir
16:24:40.967 [error] Process #PID<0.124.0> raised an exception
 ** (RuntimeError) error
    (stdlib 3.12) erl_eval.erl:678: :erl_eval.do_apply/6

iex> flush
{:DOWN, #Reference<0.1858197913.2995257347.242321>, :process, #PID<0.124.0>,
 {%RuntimeError{message: "error"},
  [{:erl_eval, :do_apply, 6, [file: 'erl_eval.erl', line: 678]}]}}
:ok
#+end_src

#+begin_notes
Monitor: being an observer of another process. If it dies or just
stops, you get a message in your mailbox. This enables processes to
detect failure in other processes they cooperate with, without it
taking them down as well (as with links).
#+end_notes

** OTP

[[./images/otp.png]]

#+begin_notes
Erlang comes prepackaged with the Open Telecom Platform (OTP)
library. The name might be confusing at first, it is actually just a
part of Erlang's standard library that is used *since 1998* to build
fault tolerance into systems.
#+end_notes

** Supervisors

#+attr_html: :width 60%
[[./images/supervisor-tree.png]]

#+begin_notes
One of the tools in the OTP library is: Supervisors.

Supervisors arrange processes in a supervised hierarchy. They use
links and monitors to bind processes together in groups. If one of the
processes dies, the supervisor tries to heal by taking action
according to a chosen strategy.

#+end_notes

*** Strategies

#+attr_html: :width 60%
[[./images/supervisor-strategies.png]]

#+begin_notes
The first one is 'one for one'. This replaces the child process that
died. This is a strategy to use whenever the children of that
supervisor are independent from each other.

The second strategy is 'one for all'. This one is to be used when the
children depend on each other. When any of them dies, the supervisor
then kills the other children before starting them all back.

You would use this when losing a specific child would leave the other
processes in an uncertain state. Imagine a conversation between
three processes that ends with a vote. If one of the process dies
during the vote, it is possible that we have not programmed any code
to handle that. Replacing that dead process with a new one would now
bring a new peer to a table that has no idea what is going on either!

This inconsistent state is possibly dangerous to be in if we haven't
defined what goes on when a process dies in a voting procedure. It is
probably safer to just kill all processes, and start afresh from a
known stable state. By doing so, we're limiting the scope of errors:
it is better to crash early and suddenly than to slowly corrupt data
on a long-term basis.

The last strategy happens whenever there is a dependency between
processes according to their booting order. Its called 'rest for one'
and if a child process dies, only those booted after it are
killed. Processes are then restarted as expected.

#+begin_notes

Demo from "The Soul of Erlang and Elixir" by Sasa Juric
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE)

=_build/prod/rel/example_system/bin/example_system start=

- Start 10000 jobs. Each job is a loop that does some CPU bound
  operations, and sends the result to a central process indicating a
  success. Then it sleeps for single second.
- Now we can test the system via a simple endpoint that calculates a
  sum of numbers.

- Webpage communicates via WebSocket to the backend system.
- Each websocket connection is running in it's own process. So that
  means each user has it's own process in the backend.
- The calculation is performed in a one-off process, that is spawned
  by the connection process. The calculation proces sends it's result
  back to the connection process, which forwards it to the user.
- Why the difficult structure? To increase fault tolerance and concurrency.

- Let's see how it behaves with some bugs.

- 13 (special number)
  - The calculation process crashes. Crash is reported to the log
    (show) and isolated (everything keeps running). When a processes
    terminates (crash or normally), other process can be notified of
    this. That is what is happening here: the connection process is
    notified and responds with an error message to the user.

- 99999999999 (big number)
  - Scheduler usage goes up to 100% but jobs keep running at 10k/s.
  - BEAM does very frequent process switching (under 1ms) and with
    proper preemption (no matter what the process does, it gets
    preempted). *BEAM promotes the progress of the system as a whole*,
    this is what high availability is about.

- -1 (naive sum implementation)
  - Scheduler maxes out: but it is still available.
  - BEAM is highly introspectible and observable. This is what I
    always found hard about the JVM..
  - =_build/prod/rel/example_system/bin/example_system remote=
  - Console process is running in the same scheduler! That this even works owes to BEAM preemption!
  - =Process.list()=
  - =hd(Process.list()) |> Process.info()=
  - We're interested in =reductions=
  - =Runtime.top()= shows processes with most reductions
  - =pid = hd(Runtime.top()).pid=
  - =Process.info(pid, :current_stacktrace)=
  - =Runtime.trace(pid)= traces execution of the process for a short while
  - =Process.exit(pid, :kill)= effectively kill -9
  - Notice: user gets =error= back, this can't be try-catched, but a
    notification is sent to the parent process.

- -1 (again)
  - Wonderful tool: =:observer.start=

- Let's fix the bugs in the code
  - =div(n * (n + 1), 2)= in math.ex
  - uncomment invalid input line in sum.ex
  - run =mix test=
  - =mix system.upgrade= deploy changes to production (without
    restarting!)  Erlang can hold two versions of a module in memory:
    an old and new version. When no processes are running the old code
    anymore, it is purged.
  - bugs have been fixed!

- Clustering
  - Distributed BEAM
  - Connected via TCP
  - Spawn process anywhere in cluster
  - Send/receive messages from processes in cluster
  - Code is the same for single node and distributed for the most part
  - Start another node: =mix system.node2=
  - Start service 'foo' and 'bar'
  - Kill node2, bar is resurrected on node1.

* Showcases
** WhatsApp
/At Facebook acquisition in 2014/

- *450 million* active users
- *54 billion* peak messages/day on 2013-12-31
- *2 million* TCP/IP peak connections (per server)

#+begin_notes
WhatsApp is using Erlang for their backend services. Even the
distributed database is in Erlang (Mnesia).

The most astonishing thing is that (in 2014) their entire engineering
team consisted of only 32 engineers. Of whom only 10 worked on the
server team. The server team of just 10 people, was responsible for
new features, maintaining existing features, *and supported the whole
system*. Basically, they were also the ones who got woken up in the
middle of the night if something went wrong.

WhatsApp achieved 2 million TCP/IP connections (each managed by a
process) on a single BEAM instance back in 2012. Though they scaled it
down to /just/ 1 million to have some room for peak hours.

Erlang is one of the things that enabled WhatsApp to scale up to the
size they are now.

[[./images/ericsson-axd-1.png]]

#+begin_notes
This is the Ericsson AXD301 which was launched in 1998: a
high-performance highly-reliable ATM switch.

This is the Erlang flagship project with over over 2 million lines of
Erlang running in it.

The AXD301 has achieved a NINE nines reliability. Let's put this in
context: 5 nines is good (5.2 minutes of downtime/year). 7 nines
almost unachievable ... Ericsson did 9.

In 2014, Ericsson reported Erlang was being used in its support nodes,
and in GPRS, 3G and LTE mobile networks worldwide and also by Nortel
and T-Mobile.
